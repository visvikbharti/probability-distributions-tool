## Features

- Interactive visualizations of Binomial, Poisson, and Normal distributions
- Interactive parameters adjustment with real-time updates
- Comparison of distribution approximations with error visualization
- Real-world application examples with simulations
- Educational content including mathematical definitions and historical context

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the app: `streamlit run app.py`

## Distributions Covered

- **Binomial Distribution**: Models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials
- **Poisson Distribution**: Models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval
- **Normal Distribution**: Models continuous variables where values near the mean are most likely
